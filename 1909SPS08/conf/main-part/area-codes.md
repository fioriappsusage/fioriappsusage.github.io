# Area codes

Area code is an attribute stored for all three types of Fiori launchpad content items managed by Fiori Tracker (Application, Catalog, Role). When you install Firoi Tracker, three default Area codes are predefined (FIN, O2C, O2D), but depending on your project scope and your choice for area naming, you can define your own Area codes.

?> Area codes help to group the listings and, what is more important, derive a person responsible based on area. This way, the person responsible is kept on the area code-to-name mapping level, which relieves from the duty of keeping it on item level.

Use point 2 form the Customizing section of [Fiori Tracker setup](/conf/main-part/changing-config.md) to define the names of functional areas in your project.
