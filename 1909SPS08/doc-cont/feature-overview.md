# Feature overview 

The main feature of Fiori Tracker is storing the details of the Fiori launchpad content of your S/4 HANA project. As Fiori launchpad content, we mean specifics of applications collected into catalogs and assigned to business roles. 

Fiori Tracker allows you to document and review both “to be” and “as is” state. By “to be” we understand what is the planned setup of your applications as a result of decisions taken by functional consultants in the “Prepare” phase. “To be” state serves as a reference for your provisioning during the “Realize” and “Deploy” phases. In case there are issues with apps “To be” allows you to make sure what applications are in scope of the solution and how the project team should configure them.
