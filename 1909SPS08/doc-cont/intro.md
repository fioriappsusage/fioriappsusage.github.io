# Fiori Apps' Usage overview

Fiori Apps' usage application comes as a dedicated tile in your launchpad. After starting the app you will get a list of all your applications sorted by their usage. You can see which place in rank they have gotten along with their tile title and type. Also, you will see how many times it was used today, in the last calendar week, how much, in total, the application was used and by whom.
