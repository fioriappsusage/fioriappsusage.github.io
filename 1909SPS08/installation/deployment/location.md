# SAP Gateway or SAP Solution Manager - on which system should Fiori Tracker be installed? 

There is one set of transports and Fiori Tracker will work on both: Solman and Gateway. You only need SAP Gateway functionality to run Fiori Tracker.

It's better to run it on SolMan though.

Here are the reasons:

1. With time Fiori Tracker becomes a repository of the vital documentation of your setup
You are going to need Fiori Tracker the most at times when your SAP Gateway undergoes the changes and could be offline or inaccessible. For example, during upgrades or issues with Fiori content. 

2. Many Fiori Tracker users chose to use it during the preparation phase when you have not yet installed SAP Gateway. 
3. Another reason is that we have designed Fiori Tracker for your project team members and in most cases, not all project team members have users on Gateway.
