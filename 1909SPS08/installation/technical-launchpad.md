# Technical launchpad

That is a standalone UI5 app with simplified tiles that allows you to start Fiori Tracker apps without full SAP Fiori Launchpad. 

Fiori Tracker users use the Technical launchpad also when they do not have roles and SAP Fiori launchpad configured yet.

It is possible to set Fiori Tracker to load the UI5 library in any available version (not only your default systems version) as long as the files are available. In the worse case, the lib files can be loaded from SAP servers on the public internet.
