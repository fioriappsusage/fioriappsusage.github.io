# Fiori Apps' Usage is free of charge

Both the Fiori Apps' Usage tool and required tool Fiori Tracker are free.

Nevertheless, as a team involved in developing the tool, we still get enough value from showcasing our skills and getting exposure.

Also, maintaining the app, lets us test organizational and technical solutions, that we can later use in commercial projects ‚úåÔ∏è

You can help us improve the tool by:
- Providing feedback from using it or testing
- Contributing to coding
- Following and interacting with our content on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/fioritracker/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FioriTracker) and [SAP Community](https://blogs.sap.com/tag/fiori-tracker/)
- Rating the app in [SAP App Center](https://www.sapappcenter.com/en/product/display-0000033126_live_v1) üíô
