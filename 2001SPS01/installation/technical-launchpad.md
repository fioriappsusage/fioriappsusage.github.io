# Technical launchpad

That is a standalone UI5 app with simplified tiles that allows you to start Fiori Apps' Usage report without full SAP Fiori Launchpad. 

Fiori Apps' Usage users can also work with the Technical launchpad in case they would not have roles and SAP Fiori launchpad configured yet.

It is possible to set Fiori Tracker to load the UI5 library in any available version (not only your default systems version) as long as the files are available. In the worse case, the lib files can be loaded from SAP servers on the public internet.
