# Apps identification

Applications on usage report are identified by matching semantic object and action with a corresponding To-be record in Fiori Tacker Core. If you want to have an App ID listed please maintain that App ID for your sematic object action pair in FT Applications app from [Fiori Tracker Core]( {{ prod.fa.compatibleCoreLink }} ).

For SAP standard apps for App ID use the "App ID" field from SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library. For example "F3140" (https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F3140')/S20OP). For custom apps the BSP name. fFor example ZFTCA.
