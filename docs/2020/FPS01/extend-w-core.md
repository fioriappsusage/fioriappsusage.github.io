# Enable apps identification and project scope control

You can extend Fiori App Usage report features by installing free component called [Fiori Tracker Core]({{ prod.fa.R2020FPS01.compatibleCoreLink }})

Installing Fiori Tracker Core will add the following features to Fiori App Usage Report:

1. [Apps identification](app-ids.md) - the columns "App ID" and "App name" will get filled with App details taken from Fiori Tracker Core records
2. Filtering on "Area" - the report will get a column named "Area" enabling you to filter entries from your project's functional areas
3. Filtering on "Application Type" - the report will get a column for application type enabling you to filter on a specific application type (f.e. get list of Custom UI5 apps only)
3. By filtering usage records without application details, you will get the list of applications outside the project scope.
