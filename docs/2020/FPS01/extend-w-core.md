# Enable apps identification and project scope control

You can enhance Fiori Apps' Report by adding an application [identification function](apps-ids.md). Install [Fiori Tracker Core]({{ prod.fau.compatibleCoreLink }}) to enable this feature.

After installing Fiori Tracker Core and recording the list of your applications in scope, the columns "App ID" and "App name" will get filled with apps' details.

By filtering usage records without application details, you will get the list of applications outside the project scope.
