# Filtering

Filtering on functional area, application type and if application is within the scope

<!-- more -->

Filtering on "Area" - the report will get a column named "Area" enabling you to filter entries from your project's functional areas

Filtering on "Application Type" - the report will get a column for application type enabling you to filter on a specific application type (f.e. get list of Custom UI5 apps only)

By filtering usage records without application details, you will get the list of applications outside the project scope.
