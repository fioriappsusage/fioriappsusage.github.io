# Building SAP Fiori roles

One of the approaches to building the user's roles is to enable all or a wide range of applications and, over time, collect usage information. With a usage report, the project can learn what users need, and based on the actual usage of the apps, the project can set up final, limited roles.




Other use cases:

[Learning about unused applications](use-cases/learning-about-unused.md)   
[Understanding apps value](use-cases/understand-apps-value.md) 
[Priority setting](use-cases/priority-setting.md)      
[Testing progress](use-cases/testing.md)       
[Apps out of scope](use-cases/out-of-scope.md)
