# Apps out of scope

Project scope creep prevention

<!-- more -->

With Fiori App Usage Report you can list the apps started by users but are not part of the project scope. On the one hand, the list can help you keep the project documentation updated. On the other hand, it can signal an uncontrolled growth in a project's scope (scope creep). Scope creep is a risk in most projects, often resulting in cost overrun.
