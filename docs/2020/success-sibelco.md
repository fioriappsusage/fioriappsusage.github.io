    *The Fiori App Usage report, part of the Fiori Tracker Suite, has helped us tremendously in the preparation for our upgrade from S4HANA 1809 with a standalone Gateway to S4HANA 2022 Embedded Gateway.  Clearly showing which apps were the most important and which could be deprecated, reducing the scope/workload for the upgrade team.  This analysis alone is an almost impossible task without Fiori Tracker, while SAP captures such analytics for every user, it is cryptic and difficult/impossible to mine.  The Fiori App Usage Report makes this very clear and easy.*

    *The report has also helped us, more than once, to audit which user had executed -unwillingly- a certain wrong action, enabling us to further optimize the roles associated to the App.  The Fiori Tracker Suite is filling a huge gap left by SAP to make such usage statistics visible to the customer.*
