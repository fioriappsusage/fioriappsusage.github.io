# Log apps usage
Speed up project timelines with app insights.

# Addressed challenges
- Repeated issues from incomplete role testing
- Low investment returns due to overlooked app potential – [unused applications](2020/FPS01/use-cases/learning-about-unused.md)
- Inadequate project team allocation due to unclear priorities  – [prioritizing based on affected users](2020/FPS01/use-cases/priority-setting.md)
- Lack of visibility into testing progress and status – [input on testing progress](2020/FPS01/use-cases/testing.md)
- Controlling project scope creep – [out of scope applications](2020/FPS01/use-cases/out-of-scope.md)

    The Fiori App Usage report, part of the Fiori Tracker Suite, has helped us tremendously in the preparation for our upgrade from S4HANA 1809 with a standalone Gateway to S4HANA 2022 Embedded Gateway. Clearly showing which apps were the most important and which could be deprecated, reducing the scope/workload for the upgrade team.  This analysis alone is an almost impossible task without Fiori Tracker, while SAP captures such analytics for every user, it is cryptic and difficult/impossible to mine. The Fiori App Usage Report makes this very clear and easy.

    The report has also helped us, more than once, to audit which user had executed -unwillingly- a certain wrong action, enabling us to further optimize the roles associated to the App. The Fiori Tracker Suite is filling a huge gap left by SAP to make such usage statistics visible to the customer.
